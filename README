Library for handling comparator networks in general and sort networks in
particular.


Utility applications
--------------------

The distribution includes a number of utility applications for handling sort
networks. Most tools operate in the typical UNIX fashion of reading from STDIN
and writing to STDOUT, so that it is able to chain tools together.

The distribution includes the following utility programs:

  * sn-apply
    Reads a list of values from STDIN and applies a given comparator network to
    the list. The resulting list of printed to STDOUT.

  * sn-batcher
    Creates a batcher bitonic-merge-sort network with a given number of inputs
    and prints the network to STDOUT. The number of inputs must be a power of
    two.

  * sn-check-bf
    Does a brute-force check whether a given comparator network is a sort
    network. It tries all 2^n 0-1-combinations resulting in exponential running
    time, so only small networks can be tested within a reasonable time.

  * sn-cut
    Remove an input by assuming positive or negative infinity to be applied to
    one input and "winning" or "losing" all comparisons.

  * sn-info
    Display information about a comparator network in human readable form.

  * sn-merge
    Combine two sort networks using the odd-even-merge network.

  * sn-normalize
    Reads a sort network and prints a normalized version to STDOUT. A
    normalized sort network is a network in which all comparators face the same
    way.

  * sn-oddevenmerge
    Create an odd-even merge network with a given number of left and right
    inputs. The resulting network is printed to STDOUT.

  * sn-oddevensort
    Creates an odd-even mergesort network with a given number of inputs and
    prints the network to STDOUT.

  * sn-pairwise
    Create a pairwise sorting network based on the paper by Ian Parberry.

  * sn-shmoo
    Prints a so-called "shmoo chart" of a comparator network to STDOUT. The
    running time of this tool is exponential, roughly O(m * 2^n) where m is the
    number of stages and n is the number of inputs.

  * sn-show
    Prints an ASCII version of a sort network to STDOUT.

  * sn-tex
    Prints the TikZ / TeX sources of a graphic representation of a comparator
    network to STDOUT.
